# File Funnel
I took system programming in the second semester of 2021, and I am starting this project to use what I have learned.
Files, presentation materials, lecture materials, etc. were not saved in each folder in advance on the computer, but were stored here and there,
so I thought about it because it was difficult to find them later when I needed them.

## Detail
+ Searches all files according to the file extension or keyword entered, such as ".c" or ".pdf" or "system programming".
+ The files are properly organized and stored neatly in the folder or device specified by the user.
  + It would be nice to add the ability to delete the original file as an option.
+ It seems that the way to organize is to give the option to create folders with similar names or files with similar creation times and put them in.
+ Also, to make it easier to find a specific file next time, it saves a list of files gathered in each directory as a txt file and allows users to comment if they want. Also, it would be good to save the location of the original file together.
  + In the case of an unorganized original file, when you want to find a specific file, it takes a long time to search through all the directories, so you can quickly find it through the organized txt file. For example, if the .c file is organized once, the path of the original file is all stored in the txt file, so next time you want to find the original file called who3.c, you can quickly find out the original file path by searching the txt file.
